It is characterised by bilateral symmetric deep white matter hyperintensity on T2 weighted images, with associated involvement of the subcortical white matter, which results in poor grey-white matter differentiation on T2 weighted images. MRS demonstrates elevation of choline (Cho). Alpha-glutamate peak is not visible."
